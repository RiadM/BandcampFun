# BandcampFun
A command line Bandcamp Downloader, just for fun not to be used for anything else. You should always support independant artist.

This program is only to learn and should not be used to download music you didn't buy.
Bandcamp already know about the possibility to download song without paying (https://bandcamp.com/zendesk/help/downloading). You should not use this program with song other than the one you bought.

I don't think someone will stumble unto this and it's probably done multiple time.
